# Lesson_5
# Topic:Entity Relationship Model
![Entity](../assets/Entity.webp)
- It is a conceptual data model for database design.

## **Learning Objectives:**
1. Explain entity relationship diagrams
2. Identify complex attributes.
3. Map cardinalities between entities
4. Determine primary keys in entity sets
5. Remove redundant attributes

## **Entity Realtionship Model:**
- The ER Model helps to represent a real-world entities and their relationships and provides a blueprint of how datas are organize and connected.
![Entity](../assets/Entity_relationship.png)
- **Entity:** Is a distinct real-world object (e.g., student)
- **Attribute:** Descriptive property of an entity (e.g., name, age).
- **Relationship:** Association among entities (e.g., student registers for course).

## **Types of Attributes:**

1. **Simple Attributes:** Are those attributes which cannot be divided into subparts.
2. **Composite Attributes:** Are those attributes which can be divided into subparts.
3. **Single-valued Attributes:** Are those attributes which has one value per entity.
4. **Double-valued Attributes:** Are those attributes which has more than one value per entity.
5. **Derived Attributes:** Are those attributes whose value for the attribute
can be derived from the values of other related attributes or entities.

## **Types of Relationships:**
1. **Binary:** Between two entities.
2. **Ternary:** Involving three entities.
3. **Unary/Recursive:** Entity related to itself.

## **Types of Keys:**

1. **Primary Key:** Unique identifier for entity; underlined in ERD.
2. **Secondary key:** is an attribute used strictly for retrieval purposes.
3. **Super Key:** Any set of attributes that uniquely identifies a record.
4. **Candidate Key:** Minimal super key.
5. **Alternate Key:** Candidate keys not chosen as primary.
6. **Foreign Key:** Refers to a primary key in another table (only in relational models).

## **Mapping Cardinalities:**
- Mapping cardinalities define how many instances of one entity relate to another in a database.

1. **One-to-One:** Each entity A is related to one entity B.
2. **One-to-Many:** A has many Bs; B has at most one A.
3. **Many-to-One:** Many A to one B.
4. **Many-to-Many:** Many A and many B (e.g., students and classes).

## **Weak Entities**
- A **weak entity type** is an entity that lacks a key attribute to uniquely identify its instances within an entity set.
- Needs a foreign key from a related entity.

## **Homework**
**Draw an entity relationship diagram for the student registration system at CST.**

## **Redundant Attributes**
- Avoid repeating data.
- Ensure each attribute is necessary and non-redundant.

## **Extended E-R Feature:**
1. **Specialization:** Subgroups of an entity set.
2. **Generalization:** Combine common features of entities.
3. **Attribute Inheritance:** Subclasses inherit attributes of the superclass.

## **Constraints**
1. **Disjoint vs Overlapping:** Can belong to one or many subclasses.
2. **Total vs Partial:** Must belong to subclass or may not.

## **Aggregation**
- Used when a relationship has its own attributes or needs to be part of another relationship.  
- It lets us treat a relationship like an entity.
