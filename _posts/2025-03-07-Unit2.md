### Topic:Entity Relationship Model
![Entity](../assets/Entity.webp)
- It is a conceptual data model for database design.

### Learning Objectives:
1. Explain entity relationship diagrams
2. Identify complex attributes.
3. Map cardinalities between entities
4. Determine primary keys in entity sets
5. Remove redundant attributes

## Entity Realtionship Model:
- The ER Model helps to represent a real-world entities and their relationships and provides a blueprint of how datas are organize and connected.

- **Entity:** Is a distinct real-world object (e.g., student)
- **Attribute:** Descriptive property of an entity (e.g., name, age).
- **Relationship:** Association among entities (e.g., student registers for course).

## Types of Attributes:

1. **Simple Attributes:** Are those attributes which cannot be divided into subparts.
2. **Composite Attributes:** Are those attributes which can be divided into subparts.
3. **Single-valued Attributes:** Are those attributes which has one value per entity.
4. **Double-valued Attributes:** Are those attributes which has more than one value per entity.
5. **Derived Attributes:** Are those attributes whose value for the attribute
can be derived from the values of other related attributes or entities.

## Types of Keys:

1. **Primary Key:** Unique identifier for entity; underlined in ERD.
2. **Super Key:** Any set of attributes that uniquely identifies a record.
3. **Candidate Key:** Minimal super key.
4. **Alternate Key:** Candidate keys not chosen as primary.
5. **Foreign Key:** Refers to a primary key in another table (only in relational models).
