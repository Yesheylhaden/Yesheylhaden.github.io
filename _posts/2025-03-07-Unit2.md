# Lesson_3
# Topic:Entity Relationship Model**
![Entity](../assets/Entity.webp)
- It is a conceptual data model for database design.

## Learning Objectives:
1. Explain entity relationship diagrams
2. Identify complex attributes.
3. Map cardinalities between entities
4. Determine primary keys in entity sets
5. Remove redundant attributes

## Entity Realtionship Model:
- The ER Model helps to represent a real-world entities and their relationships and provides a blueprint of how datas are organize and connected.
![Entity](../assets/Entity_relationship.png)
- **Entity:** Is a distinct real-world object (e.g., student)
- **Attribute:** Descriptive property of an entity (e.g., name, age).
- **Relationship:** Association among entities (e.g., student registers for course).

## Types of Attributes:
![Entity](../assets/Attributes.jpg)
1. **Simple Attributes:** Are those attributes which cannot be divided into subparts.
2. **Composite Attributes:** Are those attributes which can be divided into subparts.
3. **Single-valued Attributes:** Are those attributes which has one value per entity.
4. **Double-valued Attributes:** Are those attributes which has more than one value per entity.
5. **Derived Attributes:** Are those attributes whose value for the attribute
can be derived from the values of other related attributes or entities.

## Types of Relationships:
1. **Binary:** Between two entities.
2. **Ternary:** Involving three entities.
3. **Unary/Recursive:** Entity related to itself.

## Types of Keys:
![Entity](../assets/Keys-in-DBMS.jpg.webp)
1. **Primary Key:** Unique identifier for entity; underlined in ERD.
2. **Secondary key:** is an attribute used strictly for retrieval purposes.
3. **Super Key:** Any set of attributes that uniquely identifies a record.
4. **Candidate Key:** Minimal super key.
5. **Alternate Key:** Candidate keys not chosen as primary.
6. **Foreign Key:** Refers to a primary key in another table (only in relational models).

## Mapping Cardinalities:
- Mapping cardinalities define how many instances of one entity relate to another in a database.
![Entity](../assets/Mapping%20Cardinalities.png)
1. **One-to-One:** Each entity A is related to one entity B.
2. **One-to-Many:** A has many Bs; B has at most one A.
3. **Many-to-One:** Many A to one B.
4. **Many-to-Many:** Many A and many B (e.g., students and classes).

## Weak Entities:
- A **weak entity type** is an entity that lacks a key attribute to uniquely identify its instances within an entity set.
- Needs a foreign key from a related entity.

## Redundant Attributes
- Avoid repeating data.
- Ensure each attribute is necessary and non-redundant.

## Extended E-R Feature:
1. **Specialization:** Subgroups of an entity set.
2. **Generalization:** Combine common features of entities.
3. **Attribute Inheritance:** Subclasses inherit attributes of the superclass.

## Constraints
1. **Disjoint vs Overlapping:** Can belong to one or many subclasses.
2. **Total vs Partial:** Must belong to subclass or may not.

## Aggregation
- Used when a relationship has its own attributes or needs to be part of another relationship.  
- It lets us treat a relationship like an entity.

## Relational Model
- **Relational Model** is a way of structuring data using tables, where each table represents a relation. It's the foundation of most modern databases.

## Key Terms:
1. **Relation = Table:** A relation is represented as a table that stores data about a specific type of object (e.g., students, employees, products).
2. **Tuple = Row:** A tuple is a single record in a table. Each row contains data for one instance of the entity.
3. **Attribute = Column:** Attributes are the properties or characteristics of an entity, shown as columns in a table (e.g., name, age, ID).
4. **Database Schema:** Describes the logical design or structure of the entire database. It includes tables, their attributes, and relationships.
5. **Database Instance:** The actual data stored in the database at a particular point in time—like a snapshot of the current content.

## Structure of a Relation
- A relation is an unordered set of tuples.
- Tuples contain atomic values (indivisible).
- **NULL:** Represents missing or unknown values.
![Entity](../assets/Relation.png)

## Keys in Relational Model
1. **Primary Key:** Uniquely identifies each row (e.g., StudentNo).
![Entity](../assets/Primary%20key.png)
2. **Foreign Key:** Refers to the primary key in another table.
![Entity](../assets/Foreign%20key.png)
3. **Super Key:** Any set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple.
4. **Candidate Key:** A minimal super key (no extra attribute).
- Primary Key is selected from candidate keys.

## Schema Design
- Involves connecting tables using relationships.
- Example:

# Lesson_5
# Topic:ERD to Relational Schema
![Entity](../assets/ERD.png)

## Converting E-R Diagrams to Relational Schemas
1. **Entity Conversion:**
- Create a table for each type of entity.
- Single-valued attributes → Columns.
- Primary key attributes → Primary key for the table.
- Multivalued attributes → Separate tables.
- Composite attributes → Only sub-attributes become columns.
- Derived attributes → Excluded from the schema.

2. **Relationship Conversion:**
- Each relationship set → A relation (table).
- Attributes: Union of primary keys of participating entities.
- Include any descriptive attributes of the relationship.

3. **Cardinality Rules:**

- **1:1 Relationship:**
* If one side is partial, it takes the foreign key of the total side.
* If both sides are equal, either side can take the foreign key.

- **1: N Relationship:**
* The "many" sides gets its primary key as a foreign key in the "one" side’s table.

- **M: N Relationship:**
* A new relation/table is created with a composite primary key from the two entities.

- **Unary Relationship (Self-Referencing):**
* 1:1 - Can reference the same table using foreign keys in either direction or both.
* 1: N - Recursive foreign keys reference the same relation.
* M: N - A new table is created with composite keys referencing the entity.

4. **Ternary Relationships (3+ Entities):**
- A new table is required.
- The primary keys of all participating entities form the composite primary key.

## Specialization and Generalization

1.	**Mapping Techniques:**
- **Method 1:** Each entity in the hierarchy gets its own table.
- **Method 2:** Only subclasses have tables (with duplicated superclass attributes). Ideal for disjoint and complete inheritance.
- **Method 3:** Only the superclass gets a table. Subclass attributes are included but may lead to null values.

2. **Aggregations:**
- No additional tables are needed for aggregation; attributes are merged into relevant relations.

## Design Guidelines
1.	**Entities vs. Attributes:**
- Treat as an entity if additional information may need storage.
2.	**Entities vs. Relationships:**
- Use relationships for actions between entities.
- Simpler to represent complexity.use binary relationships, though n-ary relationships can sometimes better 

## Unified Modeling Language (UML)
- UML helps model software systems beyond data, including user interactions, functional modules, etc.
- Common UML diagrams: 
* Class diagrams.
* Use case diagrams.
* Activity diagrams.
* Implementation diagrams.

# Lesson_6

## Relational Query Languages
- Are the languages used by users to request information from a database.

## Types:
1.	**Imperative:** Specific step-by-step instructions are given.
2.	**Functional:** Queries are formed by evaluating functions that operate on the database.
3.	**Declarative:** Focus on describing the desired result rather than specifying steps.

## Relational Algebra Basics
- A functional query language forming the theoretical basis for SQL and relational databases.

## Types of Operations:
1. **Unary:** Operate on a single relation. 
- **Select:** Filters tuples based on conditions.
- **Projection:** Chooses specific attributes, rearranges or eliminates unnecessary attributes.
2. **Binary:** Operate on two relations. 
- **Union:** Combines tuples from both relations.
- **Intersection:** Finds common tuples in both relations.
- **Difference:** Finds tuples in the first relation that are not in the second.
- **Cartesian Product:** Generates all possible combinations of tuples.
- **Join:** Combines tuples based on a common attribute between two relations.

## **Key Relational Algebra Operators:**

1. **Select (σ):**
- Filters tuples meeting a condition (predicate).
- **Syntax:** σ_condition(Relation)
- **Example:** Retrieve students with ID 12345.

2. **Projection (π):**
- Extracts specific attributes from a relation.
- **Syntax:** π_attributes(Relation)
- **Example:** Retrieve the names and IDs of students.

3. **Union (U):**
- Combines tuples from two relations, removing duplicates.
- **Example:** Combine data from two student relations.

4. **Intersection (∩):**
- Retrieves tuples common to both relations.
- **Example:** Find students appearing in both datasets.

5. **Difference (-):**
- Retrieves tuples in the first relation but not in the second.
- **Example:** Find students in one relation but not in another.

6. **Cartesian Product (×):**
- Combines tuples from two relations into all possible pairs.
- **Example:** Pair student data with department data.

7. **Join:**
- Combines tuples from two relations with matching attribute values.
- **Syntax:** Relation1 ⋈_condition Relation2

## Operands and Logical Operators:
- **Logical operators used in conditions:**
* ∧ (AND)
* ∨ (OR)
* ¬ (NOT)
* , <, = (comparisons)

## Additional Relational Algebra Operators:
- **Rename (ρ):** Renames relations or attributes for clarity.
- **Assignment (←):** Assigns a relation to a variable.
- **Duplicate Elimination:** Ensures uniqueness of tuples.
- **Aggregation (Σ):** Performs calculations like sum, average, etc.
- **Sorting (τ):** Orders tuples based on specified attributes.
- **Division:** Matches tuples in one relation to tuples covering all combinations in another.
