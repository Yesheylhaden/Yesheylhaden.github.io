### Topic: Data, Database and Database System
![Database](../assets/Database%20Systems.png)

## Data
- A Data is the collection facts.

## Database
- A database is a well-organized collection of data stored on a computer, making it easy to access, manage, and update.

## Database Management System
* It is software that helps store, organize, and retrieve data efficiently.

# A Database Management System (DBMS) comprises several key components:
- Developer: Designs and maintains the database, ensuring efficiency and security.
- User: Interacts with the database to retrieve or input data.
- Application: Provides an interface between the user and the database, simplifying access to information.

## NOTE:
- Database System = Database + DBMS.
- A Database System (DBMS) is essential because traditional file-processing systems have several limitations that make data management inefficient

### file-processing system
- It is a traditional method of storing and managing data in separate files (e.g., text or CSV files), where each file is independent and handled by individual programs. 

### Limitations:
- Difficult to query and access data efficiently.
- Weak **security** and no built-in **data integrity** or **atomicity** controls.
- File-processing systems are mostly replaced by **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**, which provide more efficient and secure data management.

### Disadvantages of file-processing systems:

## 1. **Data Redundancy and Inconsistency**
   - Data is often duplicated across multiple files, leading to wasted storage and inconsistencies when updates are not synchronized across files.

## 2. **Difficulty in Accessing Data**
   - Retrieving specific data is slow and inefficient because file systems lack advanced querying capabilities and indexing.

## 3. **Data Isolation**
   - Data is stored in separate files with no integration, making it difficult to share or combine information across different parts of the system.

## 4. **Integrity Problems**
   - File systems don’t enforce data validation or relationships, leading to invalid or inconsistent data entries.

## 5. **Atomicity Problems**
   - Operations may not be completed fully or rolled back in case of failure, leaving the system in an inconsistent state (e.g., incomplete transactions).

## 6. **Concurrent-Access Anomalies**
   - Multiple users accessing the same file simultaneously can lead to conflicts, data corruption, or lost updates due to lack of synchronization.

## 7. **Security Problems**
   - File systems often lack strong access controls, encryption, and auditing, making data vulnerable to unauthorized access and breaches.

### **Advantages of Using a Database System in Applications**

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** provides a structured and efficient way to store, manage, and retrieve data, overcoming the limitations of traditional file-based systems. Let’s go through the advantages one by one:

### **1. Data Consistency**  
   - A DBMS ensures **data consistency** by maintaining a single, centralized database where all changes are reflected instantly across all applications.  
   - **Example:** In a banking system, if a customer's address is updated, all branches can access the latest information without inconsistencies.

### **2. Scalability and Flexibility**  
   - A database system allows for **scalability**, meaning it can handle increasing amounts of data and users without performance degradation.  
   - **Flexibility** means that changes in data structure (e.g., adding new fields or tables) can be made without disrupting existing applications.  
   - **Example:** E-commerce platforms like Amazon can scale to handle millions of transactions daily.

### **3. Reduction in Data Redundancy**  
   - **Normalization** in a DBMS eliminates unnecessary duplication of data, ensuring that the same piece of information is stored only once.  
   - This saves storage space and prevents **data inconsistency** (where different versions of the same data exist).  
   - **Example:** A student’s details (name, ID, and contact) are stored in one table instead of appearing multiple times in different files.

### **4. Better Security**  
   - DBMS offers robust **security mechanisms**, such as **authentication (who can log in), authorization (who can access what), and encryption (protecting data from hacking).**  
   - **Example:** In an HR database, only authorized employees should access salary details, while general employees can only view their personal records.

### **5. Data Abstraction**  
   - A **DBMS abstracts low-level storage details** and provides a simplified way to interact with data through queries.  
   - **Example:** Users do not need to know how data is stored physically; they can retrieve information using **SQL queries** like `SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'IT';`.

### **Why Database Systems are Used for Managing Data Collections**

- A **DBMS is essential** when managing data collections that meet the following criteria:

### **1. Highly Valuable Data**  
   - Some data is **critical** and must be protected against loss or unauthorized access.  
   - **Example:** In hospitals, patient records must be accurate and secure for proper treatment.

### **2. Relatively Large Data**  
   - As organizations grow, the volume of data increases significantly, making manual or file-based storage inefficient.  
   - **Example:** Social media platforms like Facebook store billions of posts, messages, and user details.

### **3. Accessed by Multiple Users and Applications**  
   - In real-world applications, multiple users **access and modify data simultaneously**. A DBMS ensures data integrity through **concurrency control mechanisms**.  
   - **Example:** In an online shopping platform, multiple users can add items to their carts, and the database ensures that stock levels are updated correctly.

### Data is the New Gold**  
- In the digital era, **data** is as valuable as gold because it drives decision-making, innovation, and business success.  
- **Database systems** help manage and organize vast amounts of data efficiently.  

### Database Systems: A Unified Information Repository**  
- A **DBMS** stores and manages different types of data in a structured, centralized way.  
- It ensures **easy access, security, and consistency** of data.  

### Examples of Database System Applications**  

**Banking & Finance**  
   - Manages **transactions, customer accounts, loans, and payments.**  
   - Example: ATM withdrawals, online banking, fraud detection.  

**Social Media**  
   - Stores **user profiles, posts, likes, messages, and connections.**  
   - Example: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter databases.  

**Sales & E-commerce**  
   - Handles **inventory, customer orders, and payment details.**  
   - Example: Amazon, Flipkart, Shopify.  

**Navigation & GPS Systems**  
   - Stores **maps, traffic updates, and route planning data.**  
   - Example: Google Maps, Waze.  

**Healthcare**  
   - Manages **patient records, prescriptions, and medical history.**  
   - Example: Hospital management systems.  

**Education**  
   - Stores **student records, course details, and examination results.**  
   - Example: University databases, e-learning platforms.

### Home work:
- what are the difference between the Database and Database Management System(DBMS)?

### Database (Definition & Characteristics) 
- A **database** is a collection of related data on individuals, places, or objects.  
- Designed for a **limited number of users** and small-scale updates.  
- Can be **manual or computer-based**, but slow without **SQL**.  
- May not guarantee **data availability** if an error occurs.  

### Database Management System (DBMS) 
- A **DBMS** is software that allows users to create, manage, and use databases.  
- Supports **multiple users** accessing and modifying data **simultaneously**.  
- Enables **fast data retrieval** using computer systems.  
- Ensures **data availability**, even during system failures.  

### **View of Data** 

- A **DBMS** supports database creation, querying, updating, and management based on a data model.  
- **Data Model** – Defines the structure, relationships, meaning, and constraints of data.  

### **Types of Data Models**  

1. **Entity-Relationship (ER) Model**  
   - Represents data as **entities (objects) and relationships** between them.  
   - Used in designing **database structures** before implementation. 
   ![Entty](../assets/Entity-Relationship%20Data%20Model.png)

2. **Semi-structured Data Model**  
   - Stores **irregular or flexible data** formats (e.g., XML, JSON).  
   - Does not follow a strict schema like relational databases.
   ![Semi](../assets/Semi-structured%20Data%20Model.png)  

3. **Object-Based Data Model**  
   - Uses **objects (like in OOP)** to store data along with behaviors (methods).  
   - Suitable for **complex applications** like CAD and multimedia databases.
   ![Object](../assets/Object%20Based%20Data%20Model.png)  

4. **Relational Model**  
   - Organizes data in **tables (relations)** with rows and columns.  
   - Uses **SQL** for querying and managing data.
   - data are represented in the form of tables/relations.  
   ![Relational](../assets/Relational%20Data%20Model.png)

### **Data Abstraction** 
 ![DataAbstraction](../assets/Data%20Abstraction.png)
- It hides the complexity of data structures from users, allowing easier interaction with the database.  
1. **Physical Level** – Defines **how data is stored** internally (e.g., file structures, indexing).  
2. **Logical Level** – Describes **what data is stored** and the **relationships** between them.
3. **View Level** – Shows **only a part of the database**, customized for different users.    

### **Database Design Steps**  
1. **Select a Data Model** – Choose the structure for organizing data.  
2. **Conceptual Design** – Define **functional requirements** and high-level schema.  
3. **Logical Design** – Map the **conceptual schema** to the database system.  
4. **Physical Design** – Optimize **storage and access methods** for performance.  

### Database Instance
- A **database instance** is the current data in a database. 

### Database Schema
- A **database schema** is its overall structure, including storage (physical) and organization (logical).

### Database Languages

1. **Data-definition language**
- Specify database schema

2. **Data-manipulation language**
- Express database queries and updates.
- A **data manipulation language (DML)** allows users to access and modify data through **retrieval, insertion, deletion, and modification** based on the data model.

### Types of DML:  
1. **Procedural DML**: Specifies **what data** is needed **and how** to retrieve it.  
2. **Declarative (Non-Procedural) DML**: Specifies **what data** is needed **without** detailing how to get it.

- A **query** is a request to retrieve information.  
- The part of DML handling retrieval is called a **query language** (e.g., SQL, which is non-procedural).  

### Database Engine
- A **database engine** is software in a **DBMS** that manages storage and handles **CRUD** operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). 
- It’s also called a **storage engine** or **embedded database**.  
- **MySQL & MariaDB** allow switching engines.  
- **PostgreSQL** has a fixed built-in engine.

### Database Engine Components  
1. **Storage Manager**: Manages data storage and connects low-level data with applications and queries.  
2. **Query Processor**: Includes **DDL interpreter, DML compiler, and query evaluation engine** to process queries.  
3. **Transaction Management**: Ensures safe and consistent execution of database transactions.
