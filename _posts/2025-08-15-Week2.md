# Title: Project Management System

## Weekly Summary:
This week, I joined the software development team and met the other interns working on the project management system. We started by reviewing the project requirements and collaborating on designing a Figma prototype for both desktop and mobile views. Despite a day’s leave due to illness, we completed the prototype and began preparing our capstone project proposal.

## Daily Logs:

### Day_1:
- Completed Figma draft and prepared for presentation.
- Presentation postponed due to team leader’s absence.
- Utilized the day to study cybersecurity topics on W3Schools.

### Day_2:
- Presented Figma draft to mentor; feedback indicated several important features were missing.
- Continued working on UI/UX Figma design.
- Made multiple improvements and adjustments based on mentor’s feedback.

### Day_3:
- Completed Figma design changes.
- Revised frontend using React and backend using Express.js.
- Studied and learned TypeScript in detail.

### Day_4:
- President Douglas visited and briefed the mentor/team leader about their role; requirements for the internship were re-explained to the team.
- Gathered ideas and insights for the capstone project from senior students.

### Day_5:
- Since the Figma prototype was completed, we asked our mentor for feedback on the design.
- Mentor informed us she would review the design on Monday.
- With no other tasks assigned, Sangay and I worked on writing the proposal for our capstone project.
- We didn’t have ideas for the capstone topic, so we asked our mentor for guidance.
- Mentor suggested continuing to develop the project management system, making it more flexible and robust.
- She mentioned that if the project succeeds, there might be future employment opportunities.

## Challenges:
- Delay in project progress due to the mentor being on leave at the start.
- Knowledge gap in Figma among some team members, requiring knowledge sharing.
- Limited tasks to do while waiting for mentor’s feedback on the prototype.
- Personal health issue causing a day’s leave and temporary absence from work.

## Plan for next week:
- Begin development of the Project Management System based on the approved Figma prototype.
- Divide development tasks among the four interns for better efficiency.
- Focus initially on building core features like task creation, assignment, and tracking.
- Schedule regular check-ins with the mentor for guidance and feedback.
