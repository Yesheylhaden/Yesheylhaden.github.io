# Title: Project Management System

## Weekly Summary:
In the second week, our primary focus was on completing and refining the Figma design for the project. The design was finalized and scheduled for mentor review on Monday. Alongside design activities, I dedicated time to self-study, particularly in React, Express.js, and TypeScript, to strengthen my development skills. We also had an interactive session with President Douglas, where the internship requirements and mentor’s role were clarified, helping us gain more direction. Additionally, we engaged in team bonding and knowledge-sharing with senior students to gather insights for the capstone project.

## Daily Logs:

### Day_1:
- Completed Figma draft and prepared for presentation.
- Presentation postponed due to team leader’s absence.
- Utilized the day to study cybersecurity topics on W3Schools.

### Day_2:
- Presented Figma draft to mentor; feedback indicated several important features were missing.
- Continued working on UI/UX Figma design.
- Made multiple improvements and adjustments based on mentor’s feedback.

### Day_3:
- Completed Figma design changes.
- Revised frontend using React and backend using Express.js.
- Studied and learned TypeScript in detail.

### Day_4:
- President Douglas visited and briefed the mentor/team leader about their role; requirements for the internship were re-explained to the team.
- Gathered ideas and insights for the capstone project from senior students.

### Day_5:
- Completed our Figma design, which will be reviewed on Monday.
- Spent time on self-study and team bonding with some of our colleagues.

## Challenges:
- Multiple iterations were required to finalize the Figma design.
- Balancing design tasks and technical learning was difficult.
- Lack of finalized confirmation on the capstone project scope created some uncertainty.

## Solution:
- Incorporated all mentor’s feedback into the Figma design to ensure completeness.
- Allocated structured time for design work and self-study separately, which improved productivity.
- Collected ideas from seniors and sought guidance from the mentor to align better with project expectations.

## Plan for next week:
- Present and finalize the Figma design after the Monday review.
- Start the development phase: build frontend components in React and set up backend with Express.js.
- Learn and apply API integration and data handling in the project.
- Draft the capstone project requirements in collaboration with the mentor.
- Continue self-study and maintain team collaboration for efficient progress.
