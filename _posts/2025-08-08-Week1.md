# Title: Project Management System

## Weekly Summary:
This week, I joined the software development team and met the other interns working on the project management system. We started by reviewing the project requirements and collaborating on designing a Figma prototype for both desktop and mobile views. Despite a day’s leave due to illness, we completed the prototype and began preparing our capstone project proposal.

## Daily Logs:

### Day_1:
- Reported to the company and was assigned a workplace in the software development team.
- Introduced to other interns, including two from Kurukshetra University, India.
- Learned that our mentor was on leave, so starting tomorrow, Sangay and I will join the other two interns to   work together on the project management system.
- The other interns had started the project one week earlier.
- They shared the current progress and explained the tasks and process we need to follow.

### Day_2:
- Had a meeting with our mentor along with the four interns.
- Mentor reviewed the progress made so far.
- Mentor explained the project requirements for the project management system.
- Noticed that the two interns from India were not familiar with Figma, while Sangay and I had experience with it.
- Sangay and I offered to share our Figma knowledge with the team.
- We all agreed to first create a Figma prototype for the website based on the project requirements.
- Started designing the Figma prototype for the Project Management System, focusing on the desktop view.
- Completed the Figma design for the desktop view of the project management system by the end of the day.

### Day_3:
- Started working on the Figma design for the mobile view.
- Finished the mobile view design by the end of the day.
- Sent home 30 minutes early due to a company meeting.

### Day_4:
- Took a leave due to severe stomach pain and diarrhea.
- Informed the team/company about the leave in advance.

### Day_5:
- Since the Figma prototype was completed, we asked our mentor for feedback on the design.
- Mentor informed us she would review the design on Monday.
- With no other tasks assigned, Sangay and I worked on writing the proposal for our capstone project.
- We didn’t have ideas for the capstone topic, so we asked our mentor for guidance.
- Mentor suggested continuing to develop the project management system, making it more flexible and robust.
- She mentioned that if the project succeeds, there might be future employment opportunities.

## Challenges:
- Delay in project progress due to the mentor being on leave at the start.
- Knowledge gap in Figma among some team members, requiring knowledge sharing.
- Limited tasks to do while waiting for mentor’s feedback on the prototype.
- Personal health issue causing a day’s leave and temporary absence from work.

## Solution:
- **Mentor on leave:** Used time to review requirements, research features, and prepare for feedback.
- **Figma knowledge gap:** Led quick training sessions to upskill team members.
- **Limited tasks:** Worked on proposal, documentation, and improvement ideas.
- **Health issue:** Informed team promptly and made up work by extra hours after return.

## Plan for next week:
- Begin development of the Project Management System based on the approved Figma prototype.
- Divide development tasks among the four interns for better efficiency.
- Focus initially on building core features like task creation, assignment, and tracking.
- Schedule regular check-ins with the mentor for guidance and feedback.
