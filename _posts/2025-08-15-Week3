# Title: Project Management System

## Weekly Summary:
This week at Tech Park Private Limited (TTPL) was focused on redesigning the user interface of our Project Management System. The main task involved creating role-based designs for different users, including Admin, Project Manager, Developer, and CEO.

## Daily Logs:

### Day_1:
- Represented our Figma design to the team.
- Received feedback to create separate designs for different user roles.
- Continued working on the Figma design.
- Designed the interface for the Admin role.

### Day_2:
- Designed the interface for the Project Manager role.
- Continued working on the design for other roles.

### Day_3:
- Designed the interface for the Developer role.
- Continued working on the design for other roles.

### Day_4:
- made the design for the developer and the CEO.
- we completed our design

### Day_5:
- Designed the interface for the Developer role and CEO role.
- Completed the overall design for all roles.

## Challenges:
- **Designing for multiple user roles:** Creating separate interfaces for Admin, Project Manager, Developer, and CEO was challenging because each role has different needs and access levels.
- **Maintaining consistency:** Ensuring the design looked cohesive across all roles while still meeting their specific requirements.
- **Time management:** Balancing the detailed design work for multiple roles within the given timeframe.
- **Incorporating feedback:** Implementing team and supervisor feedback while keeping the design functional and user-friendly.

## Solution:
- **Role-based planning:** First, analyzed the unique tasks and responsibilities of each role, then designed separate interfaces accordingly.
- **Design system approach:** Used consistent colors, fonts, and layout patterns to maintain uniformity across all role-based designs.
- **Prioritization and scheduling:** Broke down the design work day by day, focusing on one role at a time to manage time effectively.
- **Iterative improvements:** Presented designs regularly to the team, gathered feedback, and refined the interface step by step.

## Plan for next week:
- Present the completed Figma designs for final approval.
- **Start the development phase:** implement frontend components in React.
- Set up backend functionality using Express.js.
- Integrate APIs and manage data flow for the system.
- Test the interfaces and functionality for all user roles.
- Continue collaborating with the team and mentor for guidance.
- Document development progress and design adjustments.
